Your arrays containing state populations, salaries, and other information are initialized with hardcoded values. While this approach works, consider whether these values could be stored in external data sources such 
as text files or databases for easier maintenance and flexibility. Ensure consistency in the format of your data across different arrays. For example, the salaries array has some entries with tab-separated values while
others have spaces. Consistent formatting will make it easier to process the data later.
