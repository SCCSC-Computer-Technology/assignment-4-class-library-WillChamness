I had no issues loading the solution. I like that you are using that Split method with the tab delimeter to split up your info.
I imagine for a project this small it is probably the most efficient way to build your database, just using strings.
I ended up going in a much more annoying route, where I created my own mdf file in MySQL and used that.
For all of the extra work it took to get that set up, it ended up not benefiting me in the slightest. Won't do that again.
